# MMPose Implementation Plan for Challenge Scoring

## Overview
This document outlines the phase-wise implementation plan to replace MediaPipe with MMPose for more accurate challenge scoring in the iDance application.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Issues with MediaPipe Scoring:
1. **Inaccurate scores** due to simplistic algorithms
2. **No dance-specific metrics** or technique assessment
3. **Arbitrary scoring multipliers** without proper calibration
4. **Limited pose detection accuracy** for complex dance movements
5. **No reference comparison** capabilities

### Current Architecture:
- `services/ai/video_analysis.py` - MediaPipe pose detection
- `services/ai/pose_analysis.py` - Scoring algorithms
- `services/ai/movement_analysis.py` - Movement analysis
- `services/challenge/models.py` - Challenge data models

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Environment Setup

pip install mmdet[full]
```

#### 1.2 Create New MMPose Service Structure

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. MMPose Service Architecture

```python
class MMPoseService:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize MMPose models
        self.pose_model = self._init_pose_model()
        self.detector = self._init_person_detector()
        
    async def analyze_challenge_submission(self, video_url: str, challenge_type: str) -> ChallengeAnalysisResult:
        # 1. Download and process video
        # 2. Detect persons in video
        # 3. Extract pose keypoints
        # 4. Analyze dance technique
        # 5. Calculate scores
        # 6. Generate feedback
```

### 2. Dance-Specific Scoring

```python
class DanceScoringEngine:
    def calculate_technique_score(self, pose_frames: List[PoseFrame]) -> TechniqueScore:
        # Analyze proper form, alignment, technique
        
    def calculate_rhythm_score(self, pose_frames: List[PoseFrame], target_bpm: int) -> RhythmScore:
        # Analyze beat synchronization, timing
        
    def calculate_expression_score(self, pose_frames: List[PoseFrame]) -> ExpressionScore:
        # Analyze movement quality, flow, expression
        
    def calculate_difficulty_score(self, pose_frames: List[PoseFrame]) -> DifficultyScore:
        # Analyze movement complexity, skill level
```

### 3. Reference Comparison

```python
class ReferenceComparison:
    def compare_with_demo(self, submission_poses: List[PoseFrame], demo_poses: List[PoseFrame]) -> ComparisonResult:
        # Compare submission against demo video
        # Calculate similarity scores
        # Identify differences
```

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Parallel Implementation
- Keep MediaPipe running during transition
- Implement MMPose alongside existing system
- A/B test both systems

### 2. Gradual Rollout
- Start with specific challenge types
- Gradually expand to all challenges
- Monitor performance and accuracy

### 3. Fallback Mechanism
- Maintain MediaPipe as backup
- Automatic fallback if MMPose fails
- Graceful degradation

## Success Metrics

### 1. Accuracy Improvements
- **Target**: 95%+ pose detection accuracy
- **Current**: ~85-90% with MediaPipe
- **Measurement**: Manual validation on dance videos

### 2. User Satisfaction
- **Target**: 80%+ user satisfaction with new scoring
- **Measurement**: User feedback surveys
- **Timeline**: Post-implementation survey

### 3. Performance
- **Target**: <5 seconds processing time
- **Current**: ~3-4 seconds with MediaPipe
- **Measurement**: Processing time benchmarks

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Technical Risks
- **MMPose installation issues**: Comprehensive testing environment
- **Performance degradation**: Optimization and caching
- **Model accuracy**: Extensive validation testing

### 2. User Experience Risks
- **Scoring changes**: Gradual rollout with user education
- **Processing delays**: Progress indicators and feedback
- **Accuracy concerns**: Transparent scoring explanations

### 3. Business Risks
- **Development timeline**: Buffer time for unexpected issues
- **Resource requirements**: GPU/CPU optimization
- **Maintenance overhead**: Automated testing and monitoring
